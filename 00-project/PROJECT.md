# Study: Contract Staffing County Trends

## Research Question
How has the utilization of contract nursing staff (RN, LPN, CNA) varied at the county level between 2022 and 2024?

## Background
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted nursing home staffing, leading to an increased reliance on contract staffing agencies. Understanding the geographic distribution and temporal trends of this reliance at the county level is critical for policy and workforce planning.

## Objectives
1. Quantify the contract staffing ratio (Contract Hours / Total Hours) for RNs, LPNs, and CNAs.
2. Analyze the temporal trends of these ratios from 2022 to 2024.
3. Identify geographic clusters or disparities in contract staffing reliance at the county level.

## Scope
- **Time period**: CY2022Q1 to CY2024Q4
- **Population**: All Medicare-certified nursing homes reporting to PBJ
- **Geographic Unit**: County (identified by COUNTY_FIPS)
- **Key variables**: Hrs_RN_ctr, Hrs_LPN_ctr, Hrs_CNA_ctr, Hrs_RN, Hrs_LPN, Hrs_CNA

## Expected Outcomes
Identification of counties with persistent or rising contract staffing reliance and a characterization of national trends in contract staffing utilization post-pandemic.
