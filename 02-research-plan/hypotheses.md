# Research Hypotheses

## Primary Hypothesis
- **H1**: The utilization of contract staffing (as measured by the contract ratio) will show a sustained increase or stabilization at levels higher than pre-2022 averages across the majority of US counties between 2022 and 2024.

## Secondary Hypotheses
- **H2**: Rural counties will exhibit higher contract staffing ratios compared to urban counties due to local labor market shortages.
- **H3**: The reliance on contract staffing will be most pronounced for Registered Nurses (RNs) compared to LPNs or CNAs.
- **H4**: Geographic clusters of high contract staffing utilization will persist across multiple quarters, indicating localized chronic staffing challenges.
