# Research Plan: Contract Staffing County Trends

## Study Design
This is a longitudinal, descriptive study of county-level nursing home contract staffing trends using national Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Extract daily staffing records for all available quarters from 2022 to 2024.
2. **Aggregation**:
    - Calculate daily totals for contract and total hours (RN + LPN + CNA).
    - Aggregate daily facility records to quarterly facility-level means.
    - Aggregate quarterly facility-level data to county-level means (weighted by MDS census).
3. **Primary Measure**: Contract Ratio = (Contract RN + Contract LPN + Contract CNA) / (Total RN + Total LPN + Total CNA).
4. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze changes in the mean contract ratio over time, stratified by state and county-type (urban/rural).

## Analysis Plan
- Descriptive statistics of contract hours and ratios by year and quarter.
- Geospatial mapping of contract ratios by county.
- Statistical testing for significant changes in ratios over the study period.
