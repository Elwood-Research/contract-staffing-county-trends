# Regional Divergence of Contract Staffing in U.S. Nursing Homes (2022-2024)

This repository contains a research study analyzing nursing home staffing patterns using CMS Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data.

## Overview
- **Study Period**: CY2022Q1 to CY2024Q4
- **Data Source**: CMS Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) Public Use Files
- **Research Question**: How has the utilization of contract nursing staff (RN, LPN, CNA) varied at the county level between 2022 and 2024?

## Key Findings
Analysis of over 16 million daily staffing observations reveals significant regional divergence in contract staffing reliance. While some counties have successfully reduced their dependence on agency staff post-pandemic, others show persistent or rising contract ratios, highlighting geographic disparities in workforce stability.
