# Literature Review: Contract Staffing in Nursing Homes (Post-COVID-19)

## Executive Summary
This literature review examines the recent trends in contract (agency) staffing in U.S. nursing homes, focusing on the period following the COVID-19 pandemic. Key themes include the rapid rise in agency reliance, the impact of these staffing models on care quality and facility stability, and significant geographic disparities in workforce composition.

## 1. The Rise of Agency Nursing in Long-Term Care
The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a historic shift in the nursing home workforce. Studies utilizing Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data have documented a substantial increase in the use of contract labor to fill vacancies left by permanent staff turnover.

- **Bowblis et al. (2024)** found that nursing homes have increasingly turned to staffing agencies to maintain minimum staffing levels, with agency hours for RNs and CNAs reaching record highs in the post-pandemic recovery period.
- **Pradhan et al. (2025)** utilized longitudinal PBJ data to show that what was once a "stop-gap" measure has become a structural component of the staffing model for a large segment of the industry.
- **Lord et al. (2025)** noted that while agency staffing allows facilities to meet regulatory requirements, it comes with significant financial premiums that impact the long-term sustainability of the facility.

## 2. Impact on Care Quality and Workforce Stability
The transition to contract-heavy staffing models has raised concerns regarding the continuity of care and clinical outcomes.

- **Segelman et al. (2025)** identified that staffing instability, characterized by high turnover and frequent use of agency staff, is negatively associated with various quality measures, including pressure ulcer prevalence and rehospitalization rates.
- **Whitman & Weech-Maldonado (2026)** highlighted that the "skill mix" (the ratio of RNs to other staff) is often compromised when facilities rely on agencies, which often provide more LPN and CNA hours than high-level RN oversight.
- **Yang et al. (2023)** found that while contract staff can prevent total labor shortages, they do not provide the same benefits to resident outcomes as stable, facility-employed Nurse Practitioners and RNs.

## 3. Geographic and Regional Disparities
Geographic location significantly influences a facility's ability to recruit and retain permanent staff, leading to regional variations in agency reliance.

- **Orewa et al. (2025)** demonstrated that rural nursing homes face unique financial and recruitment challenges compared to urban counterparts, often having less access to the same pool of agency labor but higher costs when they do use it.
- **Falvey et al. (2023)** showed that facilities located in neighborhoods with severe deprivation have significantly lower staffing levels and higher reliance on temporary staff, further exacerbating health disparities for residents in those areas.
- **Quigley et al. (2021)** reviewed the urban-rural divide, noting that rural facilities often have different staffing compositions that affect their response to national policy changes.

## 4. Conclusion
The literature suggests that contract staffing has moved from a temporary crisis response to a permanent feature of the nursing home landscape. However, the geographic nuances—specifically at the county level—and the trends extending into late 2024 remain under-explored, providing a clear opportunity for further research.
