# Synthesis: Contract Staffing Trends and Existing Literature

## 1. Contextualizing Observed Trends (2022–2024)

The analysis of PBJ data from 2022 through 2024 reveals a diverging landscape in nursing home contract staffing reliance across the United States. While the literature initially characterized the post-pandemic increase in agency use as a nationwide phenomenon (Bowblis et al., 2024), our findings suggest a significant regional bifurcation.

- **Diverging Paths**: States like Florida (FL) and Georgia (GA) have seen dramatic reductions in contract labor ratios, with FL dropping from 9.4% in 2022 to 2.1% in 2024. This suggests that in these regions, the "agency surge" may have been a temporary crisis response, potentially mitigated by state-level interventions or improved local labor market conditions.
- **Structural Persistence**: Conversely, Vermont (VT) and North Dakota (ND) exhibit persistent and even increasing reliance on contract staff, with VT's ratio rising to 27.1% by 2024. These findings align with Pradhan et al. (2025), who argued that contract labor has become a structural fixture rather than a temporary fix for a large segment of the industry.

## 2. Temporary Surge vs. Structural Fixture

The debate over whether agency staffing is a transient post-COVID artifact or a permanent shift is clarified by our county-level analysis. 

- **The "Crisis-Recovery" Model**: In many southern and midwestern counties, the sharp decline in agency hours suggests a return toward pre-pandemic staffing models, supporting the view that temporary labor was a necessary but ultimately undesirable stop-gap (Yang et al., 2023).
- **The "Structural Dependency" Model**: In rural and historically underserved regions (VT, ND, and parts of the Pacific Northwest), the lack of a downward trend indicates a deeper workforce crisis. As noted by Orewa et al. (2025) and Quigley et al. (2021), rural facilities face unique recruitment hurdles that may force a permanent reliance on high-cost agency labor to meet minimum staffing mandates.

## 3. Implications for National Policy and Stability

The geographic disparities identified have profound implications for national nursing home policy:

- **Staffing Mandate Feasibility**: A "one-size-fits-all" federal staffing mandate may be achievable in states like FL/GA that have stabilized their workforce, but could prove financially catastrophic for facilities in VT/ND where nearly one-third of staffing hours are sourced through expensive agencies.
- **Financial Sustainability**: The financial premiums associated with contract labor (Lord et al., 2025) continue to pose a threat to facility stability in high-ratio regions. This creates a "quality trap" where facilities must spend more on temporary staff, leaving fewer resources for permanent staff retention or capital improvements.
- **Workforce Equity**: The persistence of agency labor in specific regions exacerbates existing health disparities (Falvey et al., 2023), as resident care quality may be compromised by the lack of continuity associated with transient staff.

## 4. Addressing Identified Research Gaps

Our results directly address the gaps identified in previous reviews:

- **Temporal Resolution**: By incorporating data through late 2024, we show that the "post-pandemic" period is not monolithic; recovery is state-dependent.
- **Geographic Granularity**: Moving to the county level reveals that even within states like FL, some counties recovered faster than others, highlighting the hyper-local nature of nursing home labor markets.
- **Transition Dynamics**: We identify "hotspots" of contract staffing reliance where the model has shifted from crisis response to a permanent (and likely fragile) structural fixture.

## 5. Key Talking Points for Discussion

- **The Myth of Universal Recovery**: While national averages might show a decline in agency use, this masks critical regional failures where dependency is hardening.
- **Policy Tailoring**: Federal and state policies must move beyond broad mandates to address the specific labor market failures in high-dependency states like VT and ND.
- **Economic Resilience**: Research should investigate why states like FL/GA successfully reduced agency reliance—whether through legislative limits on agency rates, targeted workforce grants, or other mechanisms.
- **Quality Continuity**: The persistent 20%+ agency ratios in some states represent a significant risk to care continuity, requiring urgent attention from quality-of-care regulators.
