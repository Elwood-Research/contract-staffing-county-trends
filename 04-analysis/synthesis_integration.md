# Synthesis Integration: Empirical Findings and Literature Context

## Overview
This document synthesizes the empirical findings from the PBJ analysis (2022-2024) with existing literature on nursing home contract staffing.

## Alignment with Prior Research
- **Shift to Structural Models**: Our finding of persistent high agency ratios (>20%) in VT and ND confirms the hypothesis by Pradhan et al. (2025) that contract labor is becoming a structural fixture in specific market segments.
- **Geographic Disparities**: The concentration of high reliance in rural states (VT, ND, MT) aligns with Orewa et al. (2025) and Quigley et al. (2021), highlighting the unique challenges of rural nursing home labor markets.

## Novel Contributions
- **Evidence of Recovery**: The significant reductions in FL (9.4% to 2.1%) and GA (9.6% to 3.1%) provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that the "agency surge" can be reversed in some markets, suggesting it was a temporary crisis phenomenon in those regions.
- **Temporal Extension**: Analysis through 2024-Q4 provides the most current assessment of the staffing landscape following the end of the federal Public Health Emergency, showing a stabilization in some areas and continued crisis in others.

## Limitations Related to PBJ Data
- **Daily Aggregation**: While PBJ data allows for precise hour counts, it does not distinguish between different agencies or provide the exact cost of contract labor, only the quantity.
- **Paid Hours Only**: PBJ records reflect paid hours, not necessarily hours worked, though in the context of agency labor, these are typically identical.
- **Contract vs. Permanent Dynamics**: PBJ data does not capture the qualitative reasons *why* staff left permanent positions for agencies (e.g., burnout vs. pay), though our geographic results suggest market-level economic factors play a role.

## Discussion Talking Points
1. **Regional Bifurcation**: The U.S. nursing home staffing market is splitting into "recovery" and "dependency" regions.
2. **Policy Implications**: National mandates must account for the 27%+ reliance in some states to avoid unintended facility closures.
3. **Future Research**: Investigating state-specific policies in FL and GA that may have contributed to their rapid staffing stabilization.
